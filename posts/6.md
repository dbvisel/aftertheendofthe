The airport again, though there's something distinctive here: banners for the fortieth anniversary of Gaddafi's hold on power, seen hanging on the wall on the right; there are two other banners featuring the leader, though it's harder to tell what they're about. These banners were slightly old at this point â€“ the fortieth anniversary would have been celebrated in 2009. The photo is bad because I don't want to look like a tourist, focusing on the banner. 

What I notice now is the man in the lower right, talking on his phone, slightly tense: normal life in the midst of a scene I was finding novel, if not extraordinary.
