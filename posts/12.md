A gazelle eating some kind of grain off the pavement. It's a wonderful thing to come across unexpected gazelles in a public square at night, exactly what one wants out of travel; but soon you start to wonder about what it means, where the gazelles come from, whether it's ethical to pay a man to take a picture with a gazelle that comes from who knows where. Do the gazelles like having their picture taken? Probably not. Is it wrong to encourage gazelle photographers: probably? Though perhaps it's part of cultural norms which I at least could not pretend to understand. Maybe these gazelles are actually leading better lives than they would have out in the desert; here they were given food so that they would be perky. We left them alone, not sure how to resolve these issues.
