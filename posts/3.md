There's a blurriness to this photo that suggests furtiveness, though perhaps that's just incompetence. The baggage claim in Tripoli, the first photo I took after landing, still not sure what the rules were. A lot of men, which is probably what I was trying to capture. Everyone in dark and drab colors. But details stand out: the woman with the red headscarf on the left, turned towards me, probably noticing that I was taking a photograph. On the right, a baby in a stroller, what might be its mother bent down behind.

This airport was damaged in 2014 and is no longer operational.
