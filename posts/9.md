We are at the hotel, in a room. I don't bother taking a picture of the room, and I can't remember what the room is like; I can remember very little about this hotel, where we stayed for several days. Perhaps I felt afraid to take pictures of the hotel? Seeing what a tourist hotel in Tripoli looked like in the last days of Gaddafhi now seems like it would be an interesting thing. At the time it did not, I am assuming; perhaps I was trying to pass as a jaded traveler who didn't see hotels except as a necessary inconvenience on the way to getting where you really wanted to be. 

Google Maps makes it seem like the Al-Kendi is still operational, though fallen on hard times. Some of the photos look familiar, though how worn it was at the time I can't remember.
