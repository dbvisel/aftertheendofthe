But it is still tempting to want to pet a gazelle if you can: this is something that did not happen where I was from. It is hard to resist. 

Later I would move to Southeast Asia with a small child and run into a world of animal attractions – from cat cafés to the government snake farm – which are perhaps not problematic for the causal visitor but do make one start to wonder given enough time. A small child loves a cat café. Do the cats love being in a cat café? In Bangkok, when we were there, literally anyone could start a cat café. Probably one of them had gazelles in it to distinguish itself. It's easy to say these things are wrong when you're in the West and there are clear laws. It is harder when you are in Bangkok and there is a cat café that your child wants to visit but that you know will make you feel queasy.
