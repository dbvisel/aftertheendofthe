The first of these pictures that shows anyone I was traveling with: A. sits down on the gazelle's divan. I don't think this was supposed to happen: I think you were supposed to make an arrangement with the owner of the gazelle about being photographed with the gazelle. The owner is nowhere in sight here; later, I think they became upset with us taking pictures of gazelles when they should be taking pictures of us with the gazelles and being paid to do this. Perhaps this is a picture of the scene that angered the owner of the gazelle.

What I most remember about this scene is something that I don't think I photographed: someone opening the trunk of their car and there being a gazelle inside.
