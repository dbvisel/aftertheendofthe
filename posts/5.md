This is the sort of photo that gets edited out of anything. It is out of focus, the scene it shows is familiar – people standing around a small airport waiting for bags – and it's not clear what the focus might be except perhaps the octagonal skylight. I don't know who any of the people are; I don't have a particular connection to the Tripoli International Airport. Should this photo be deleted? This answer now is certainly yes. I didn't, but was that inattention or a sense that there was something worth hanging on to here? And I still feel hesitant to delete this.
