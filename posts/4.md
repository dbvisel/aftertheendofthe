Again the baggage claim, more in focus now. It's not as clear to me what I was taking a picture of here. The same drably clad men, but more women now. A man talking on a cellphone, not yet an iPhone, maybe not even a smartphone. The man in the center talking to the woman is the focus: who is he? He seems important – an official of some sort? He looks like one of the Gaddafi sons, maybe Mutassim, though certainly it is not him – maybe that is what a fashionable Libyan man looked like at that point in time.
