And then the end of the night, a blurry vision of Green Square. I can't tell if this is a bad photo because I was bad at taking photos (still true) or if it's because I was afraid of taking photos too obtrusively. I suspect the green glow in the air is entirely an accident. If this were not so blurred you could see the gazelle divans on the right; in the background would be the Mediterranean; and to the left is the castle. The castle is attractive; Green Square might have been attractive if it were not full of cars and if the lights weren't so scalding. But it's not my square.
