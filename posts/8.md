This is what the traveler wants: a beautiful sunset and a big billboard of the leader, propaganda shining into the evening! The photo is blurry and I can't tell what it's about, presumably his model for African unity. 

What I wasn't trying to take a picture of was the parking lot full of cars; presumably we are still leaving the airport. The cars are very ordinary; maybe a little older than they might be, but cars that would fit in to the parking lot of an airport anywhere in the world. There is nothing special about the cars. Seen in retrospect should they assume more importance? A record of a time before everything changed when things seemed normal?
